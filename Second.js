=       ->  Assignment
==      ->  Comparing just value
===     ->  comparing data and data type

var a = 10
var b == 10
var c === "10"


a==220
false
a == "10"
true
a==="10"
false



var : value override everytime don't keep static value 

in ES5 we have only one way to declare variable if.e. var 

in ES6 we have 2 way to declare variable 

let and const 

var a= 20  two line code for java Script 
var a declare
a=20 Assignment


a
20
a=30
30

let c=70
undefined
c
70
let c=90
SyntaxError: redeclaration of let c
debugger eval code:1:1
c=90
90

const a = 30
undefined
a
30
const a = 20
SyntaxError: redeclaration of const a
debugger eval code:1:1
a=20
TypeError: invalid assignment to const `a';



var = redeclare and reassign
let = cannot redeclare but can reaasign
const = cannot reassign and cannot redeclare
